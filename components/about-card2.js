                    <p>To promote and foster the spirit of entrepreneurship
                        among the stakeholder of the college and to create
                        an environment that nurtures technopreneurs for
                        employment and social impact. </p>
                    <p>
                        Our vision is to make students and faculty ‘entrepreneurial’ in every work that they do. We hope to enable them to solve global challenges as we see students as the greatest capital and intend to nurture them, provide them with opportunities for excellence.
